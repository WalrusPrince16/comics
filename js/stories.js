    But like its 3am and you're feeling sad and you DM her and she scolds you for being up but comes over and you go for a walk with her and your dog and tell her how much you love her and she says it back and and you walk her home so she's safe and go home and wake up at noon.
    \n
    But like she wakes you up with a king's breakfast and watches a holocaust documentary with you while laughing at your jew jokes and tweeting from your main account because you trust her enough to let her do that and then you try and play Minecraft with her but she sucks at it.
    \n
    But like while you're playing Minecraft she touches your hand lightly and you can feel her pure energy for that brief second and you forget your pain at being a failure and your heart returns to a primordial state free of sin and sadness and she gives you a sweet smile.
    \n
    But like you don't hear from her for a few days u start to panic and she tells u that she's not ready for a relationship yet and that she should never have said she loved u to begin with and your heart is tempted by a primal hate so ancient yeah seemingly right in your sadness.
    \n
    But like you start to smile a forced smile and that hate bubbles into a frenzied energy that clouds your mind and your smile grows wider as you stare at your screen alone in the dark until you begin to cry and the realization you are truly alone sets in and you want to die.
    \n
    But like you're sitting alone at the table starring at an empty plate and you haven't heard from her since she told you she didn't want a relationship and like you haven't eaten in two days and you boss is calling for you to go into work and you just smash your phone to stop it
    \n
    But like you just sit there for another day and start laughing again and try to commit un-alive but you're too scared to do it and just fall asleep on the kitchen floor after swallowing a whole bottle of melatonin and you wake up 3 days later in a hospital.
    \n
    But like when you wake up you see her looking over you but when your eyes adjust you realize its just a nurse that looks kinda like her and she tells you that your mom brought you here after she found you on the floor and your mom comes over to you.
    \n
    But like your mom is crying tells you she's so sorry for what happened to her. But you're like what? But like she tells you that your love was burned alive by her new bf on a livestream because he caught her about to text you and she just assumed that's why you took the pills.
    \n
    But like, you realize that the White race is doomed and become a doomer zoomer nationalist and spend all day online to get over your murdered gf and then one day you get a DM from QueenOfEvropa88 and you open it in amusement, presuming her to be a federal agent...
    \n
    But like, you start talking to her and realize that you have a lot in common aside from your animosity to the Jewish Tribe as you've both lost loved ones recently and like she video calls you and she's stunningly beautiful and and tells you that you look like the doomer wojak...
    \n
    But like, you respond by telling her that she looks like the trad-wife wojak and you both laugh and just talk until 3am when she falls asleep but like when you wake up in the morning, you feel ok for once and eat a healthy king's breakfast while awaiting her reply to your gm post
    \n
    But like, she doesn't DM you all day and you start to get worried but she DMs you and says "sorry i was asleep lol (kisses)" and you're so happy and she asks where you live and you give her your address and she's like "omg that's only 10 minutes away!" and she comes over...
    \n
    But like, you wait there for hours and hours and she never shows up or answers you DMs you and you refresh the page and find that she blocked you so in a state of agony you visit her profile on a private tab and scroll down to see her pinned tweet...
    \n
    But like, her pinned tweet is a screen cap of your address and face next to a racist tweet you sent and and hundreds of Antifa have liked and RT'd it and they show up to your house and burn your car and kill your dog and you fire a round at them in self-defense and they run...
    \n
    But like, the police show up and charge you with multiple felonies and shoot your dog again before throwing you in the back of their cruiser and booking you in the local jail. But like.... But like... But.....
    \n
    But like, you get out of jail 3 years later and some of your old Bros from twitter DM you and ask you if you want to go to Japan with them in search of a Japanese QT to wife up and of course you agree and you guys all head out to the airport...
    \n
    But like on the plane you see a beautiful happa QT playing Minecraft on the Switch (she sucks at and is playing in creative mode) but you, being the Chad that you are, ditch your friends to sit by her and like she gives you a cute little smile and you nervously say hi...
    \n
    But like, she's kinda young and you can't tell how old she is and you decide that the best way to find out if she's 16 (give or take a few years) is to ask her if she has a twitter and she's like yeah and you look up her @ and her bio is like "15 | ACAB | BLM | Mental Illness"
    \n
    But like, she says "oh haha I'm actually 19 I haven't been on here in years lol" and she's like "follow me back??" and you follow her back on your locked account and she just starts scrolling when the announcements come on to turn your phone on airplane mode...
    \n
    But like, you don't talk much on the plane and its a long flight and she falls asleep on your shoulder (it's extremely cute) and your bros get jealous and one of them comes over and wakes her up and offers her his seat (he had a whole row to himself) and she goes and sleeps...
    \n
    But like, you're pretty mad at your bro but calm yourself down as to not cause a scene on the plane and just go to sleep listening to jpop on your iPhone6 and when you wake up, half the plane is already gone and you rush to catch up with your bros...
    \n
    But like, you can't find her in the airport anywhere and your bros are all checking out the Japanese QT's and just look past them all and your bro that woke her up earlier is up ahead and talking her up so you rush up and say hi and she gives you a glance and a little "hi"...
    \n
    But like, you guys get to the hotel later and the boys all go out on the town while you stay in and just browse twitter like a chad and make racist jokes about George Floyd's grandson who just got knee'd to death after murdering 5 women and 4 officers and also named the jew...
    \n
    But like, you get a DM from HappaQT16 and she's like "hey I'm all settled in and your friend bailed on me for my younger sister :(... wanna hang out???" and you're like "yeah," so you go get some terrible Japanese food and she's like "Doomer-Chan, wanna go see the anime trees???"
    \n
    But like, you go and sit under one of the anime trees with her and she says "Doomer-Chan..." and you're like "Happa-Chan" and she lays her hand on yours and you feel her pure energy flow through your body and the layers of darkness around your soul begin to fall away...
    \n
    But like, you hold her hand (your hands are sweaty) and you think about going in for the big anime-style kiss to seal your love for her but you hear your friends approaching (drunkenly) and yelling for you, and some other things about jews
    \n
    But like, you're furious at this point, these "bros" of yours just ruined perhaps the sweetest and holiest moment of your life and it takes all your willpower to not just throw his phone on the ground as he's showing you some cringe joke about 6 million wooden doors
    \n
    But like, one of your friends, the Chad that walked off with Happa-Chan earlier, starts flirting with her and you completely lose it, and just start slamming his face into the trunk of the anime tree, unleashing all your darkness and rage with each motion until you're pulled back
